PRs that add or modify contact information must be verified as correct prior to being merged.

Acceptable methods of verification include:

* **Reference an official website.** Provide a reference to an official website with the information that was submitted.
* **Make a public tweet.** Use an established Twitter account that represents the organization to tweet a link to the PR.
* **Use a dumb contract.** Have an established, contractual business relationship with Trail of Bits.

If none of these work, please indicate why in the PR and we'll do our best to work it out.
